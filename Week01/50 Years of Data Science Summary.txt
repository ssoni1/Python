50 Years of Data Science Summary
The article depicts the facts and debate behind the evolution of Data Science. Initially, it elaborates the thoughts and opinions of various statisticians about the Data Science and Statistics. There was a buzz when John Tukey and his companions John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Bierman raised a concern for the reformation of academic statistics with the evolution of a new field called “Data Science”. To the statisticians this new field was awful as they considered data science as only statistics, which can easily deal with large amount of data. After one press release of University of Michigan for using the new datasets of “Big data” for handling a large amount of data that will be coming in future, statisticians considered this new fancy field as waste because the old computation methodology of single processor can handle any amount of data more easily than touting these new fields.
Furthermore, the article enlightens on the job availability of databases and data analytics through Mike Barlow’s prediction of 4.4 million jobs for Data Science in near future. Adding to that, article explains us about the CTF which plays a vital role in Machine learning with the combination of predictive modelling culture. The article also suggests how the statisticians were convinced that the Data Science is not “only statistics”, whereas its an amalgamation of statistics, analysis, big data and machine learning. Therefore, later with time data science evolved as a new field and now it is a competitive and innovative field which is being taught in many universities.
To recapitulate, the contemplating field “Data Science” is a new field which is considered as a ray of hope for millions with respect to jobs as the raw data is increasing rapidly and in future, we would need millions of “Data Scientists” to occupy this job role to process the data.
